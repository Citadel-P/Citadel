# Citadel architecture

This guide defines where code belongs and the boundaries to preserve when changing
Citadel. For setup and commands, see [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md). For the wire
contract between Core and Agent, see [Agent protocol](agent-protocol.md).

## System overview

Citadel Core serves the HTTP API, frontend and realtime connections. It stores
configuration, authorization, activities, operation claims and runtime projections
in PostgreSQL. Background workers collect observations and execute queued work.

Core reaches Docker through one of three paths:

| Path | Connection | Execution owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | Core connects to Docker | Core's Docker adapter |
| Direct Agent | Core calls an Agent over gRPC | Agent |
| Edge Agent | Agent maintains an outbound gRPC stream to Core | Agent |

Agents execute Docker and external-tool operations without a database. Core owns
persistence, user authorization, target selection and operation scheduling. Build
Pools use the same Agent executable; Swarm-node Agents use a restricted profile.

## Repository layout

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/server/` | HTTP/realtime presentation, composition, startup and workers |
| `src/agent/` | Agent configuration, authentication, Direct/Edge dispatch and lifecycle |
| `src/features/` | Business models, use cases, typed errors and consumed interfaces |
| `src/infrastructure/adapters/` | PostgreSQL, Docker, Agent, filesystem and security implementations |
| `src/infrastructure/database/` | Declarative schema, migrations and migration runner |
| `src/infrastructure/contracts/` | Core/Agent protobufs and generated bindings |
| `src/infrastructure/docker-api/` | Generated Docker protocol client and pinned source schema |
| `src/infrastructure/processes/` | Bounded subprocess execution, cancellation and cleanup |
| `src/infrastructure/runtime/` | Task supervision, queues, I/O budgets and metrics |
| `src/frontend/` | React application and generated API client |
| `src/tools/` | Generators, build scripts and development tooling |
| `src/.sqlx/` | Offline SQLx query metadata |
| `test/` | Cross-system fixtures, test runners and performance tools |
| `deploy/` | Compose files, environment templates and local settings |
| `schema/` | Generated full and public OpenAPI documents |

Crate-specific tests stay beside their crates. Cargo's workspace and toolchain
files remain at the repository root.

## Dependency rules

- Features may depend on other features, but never on Server, Agent or infrastructure.
- Infrastructure implements feature interfaces and may depend on features or other
  infrastructure crates. It must not depend on Server or Agent.
- Server and Agent compose features and infrastructure. They must not depend on
  each other.
- HTTP types, `utoipa` schemas and API views belong in Server. Generated Docker and
  Agent protocol types stay at infrastructure/transport boundaries.
- Cross-feature dependencies must be acyclic and have a clear owner. Prefer an
  existing narrow interface over a new shared framework.

`primitives` owns small shared concepts such as actor IDs, permissions, audit
metadata and patch vocabulary. `execution` owns process request/result types and
the `ProcessRunner` interface. Concrete process execution belongs in infrastructure.

The architecture tests inspect Cargo dependencies as well as source boundaries:
[resource_structure.rs](../src/server/tests/resource_structure.rs) and
[resource_architecture.rs](../src/server/tests/resource_architecture.rs).

## Organizing a feature

Use responsibility-based files within the owning feature. Add only the roles the
feature needs; split a large file into a module when that makes navigation clearer.

| Role | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `model` | Resource state, value objects and invariants |
| `commands` | Transport-neutral mutation inputs |
| `service` | Use-case orchestration |
| `repository` | Durable persistence interfaces and atomic operations |
| `read_models` | Summaries, configuration results, filters and previews |
| `runtime` | Interfaces for Docker, Agent or external execution |
| `permissions` | Named operation requirements |
| `jobs`, `adoption`, `webhooks` | Feature-specific workflows |

Keep `lib.rs` and `mod.rs` focused on module declarations and deliberate exports.
Do not introduce empty services or generic base entities just to make every
feature look identical.

### Models and persistence

Use the business resource name, such as `Deployment` or `BackupPolicy`. Resources
may include tags and related metadata loaded efficiently by their repository;
a separate `*Details` wrapper is not mandatory. Use smaller projections when a
list, worker or lookup only needs a subset of the data.

Reuse shared vocabulary where semantics match. Resource-specific state and
validation stay with the feature. Decode persisted enum values and JSON into
feature types at the repository boundary.

Use `Repository` for durable business resources, `Store` for projections, samples
or transient state, and `Reader` for read-only queries. Keep claims, row-version
checks, idempotency and multi-resource transactions in cohesive operations.
Do not replace one atomic operation with several unrelated repository calls.

SQL and row mapping live under `adapters/src/persistence/postgres/`. Repositories
return feature models, not API views. Catalog queries apply authorization in SQL;
loading an unrestricted catalog and filtering it in memory is not acceptable.

### HTTP and realtime presentation

`src/server/src/api/routes/` owns endpoint registration, extraction and HTTP responses.
`src/server/src/api/resources/` owns request DTOs, views, patch handling and mappings.
Keep routes thin: authorize, call the feature, then map the result.

Use `From` for context-free projections and named mapping functions when actor
permissions or other context are required. Preserve field names, nullability and
secret redaction. Feature errors retain their meaning until Server maps them to
sanitized HTTP errors; unexpected failures are logged internally.

Realtime consumes feature interfaces and shared presentation mappings. It does
not import HTTP route modules or select Local, Direct and Edge transports itself.

## Composition and lifecycle

Server parses and validates configuration before constructing services.
`src/server/src/composition/` builds typed components once and passes narrow handles
to routes and workers. Constructors receive settings explicitly rather than
reading environment variables themselves.

Core applies migrations and acquires its background-job lease before running
workers. Only one Core process may own that lease for a database. Shutdown cancels
listeners and workers, drains tracked work, then closes database resources.
Every spawned task needs an owner, cancellation policy and shutdown behavior.

Interactive streams normally end with their caller. Durable operations use
persisted claims and may continue after a browser disconnect. Recovery inspects
and settles interrupted work; it must not blindly replay ambiguous mutations.
PostgreSQL notifications are wakeups, while claims and queue rows remain authoritative.

Platform and Build Pool connection transitions publish typed events on
`citadel_connection_events` within the transaction that persists the transition
and its activity. PostgreSQL delivers them after commit. The shared
`DatabaseNotificationHub` forwards these to `ConnectionEventHub`; consumers use
`notifications.connections.subscribe()` independently. The realtime subscriber
publishes resource invalidations, and authorized readers load the current state.
Repeated health observations and obsolete Edge sessions do not emit transitions.
Listener reconnects and subscriber lag trigger a resync of both resource types.
This bounded stream is for notifications; durable activities and alert work remain
in PostgreSQL. Adding a subscriber does not require wiring callbacks into stores.

## Runtime routing and observations

`PlatformRuntimeRouter` resolves persisted Platform identity or an exact Swarm
node and exposes the capability needed by the caller. Registered Direct consumers
share a connection registry; Edge owns a separate session registry. Registration
validates proposed addresses before they become persisted routing targets.

Keep information, health, statistics, inventory and mutation interfaces narrow.
A container collector should not enumerate images or volumes. Native Swarm
operations validate manager identity, ownership and the whole selection before
mutation. Confirmed successful removals remain committed even if a later item fails.

Preserve these rules in event and recovery work:

- Known container lifecycle events update state without fetching full metadata.
  Metadata changes and deletion use their own observation paths.
- Batches are bounded and scoped to the Platform/node. Generation, timestamp,
  row-version and Edge-session checks reject superseded observations.
- Daemon events must not overwrite operation claims. Operation completion owns
  final parent status, activity and claim release.
- Publish realtime changes after persistence commits, scoped to affected resources.
- Reconnect and periodic reconciliation repair missing observations. Health probes
  do not trigger full inventory collection while a Platform is stable.

Statistics use bounded shared writers and batch database writes separately from
sampling. Realtime can deliver a sample before its history is flushed. Telemetry
retries have finite retention and explicit discard metrics; durable operation
claims and alert observations must not use that lossy policy.

## Authorization and secrets

Identity owns permission evaluation and its process-local cache. Permission
mutations acquire the cache mutation fence **before** a database connection and
publish invalidation through the commit path. Readers retain the matching fence
through query and cache publication. Rollbacks do not publish a successful change.

Known-resource permission checks can be batched. Realtime connections bind their
permission decisions to an actor generation; invalidation closes affected
connections and streams. Raw observations may be shared across subscribers, but
permission decisions and presentation remain actor-specific. Manual ACL changes
outside these mutation paths require cache invalidation, such as restarting Core.

Credential files and Git/Automation workspaces belong to infrastructure adapters.
Use private staging, bounded subprocesses and cleanup on success, failure and
cancellation. Git SSH requires verified host keys; do not disable host verification.
API responses, logs and activity snapshots must not disclose stored secrets.

## Frontend and generated contracts

The frontend uses the full Rust OpenAPI schema. Server owns `utoipa` definitions;
feature crates do not depend on them. Generate both API documents and the TypeScript
client together; see [API changes](DEVELOPMENT.md#api-changes). Do not hand-edit
schemas or generated client types.

Shared resource pages and UI components own layout, status badges, loading states
and actions. Appearance uses CSS variables and shared density/radius tokens.
Semantic health colors keep their meaning regardless of the selected accent.

The Agent protobuf inventory and Docker API generation inputs have their own
contract checks. Changes to either require verification of the generated output
and affected runtime mappings, not just successful compilation.

## Making a change

1. Put business behavior in its feature, external I/O in its adapter and wire
   presentation in Server or Agent.
2. Preserve authorization, transaction, cancellation and recovery boundaries.
3. Reuse an existing type or interface only when its semantics match.
4. Run focused tests, architecture checks and relevant schema verification.
   Use disposable external-service fixtures for integration tests.

Test runners and fixture requirements are listed in [test/README.md](../test/README.md).
